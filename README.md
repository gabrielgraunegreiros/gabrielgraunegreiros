### Hello World ðŸ‘‹, welcome to my profile, my name is Gabriel Grau Negreiros

I'm a systems engenieer student, I like to build mobile apps and always be updated about the latest technologies and tendencies about mobile development. My main framework is Flutter for hybrid mobile development, and for native development my main programming language is Java. Also I like to be constantly improving the UI/UX section in my projects so they can generate an impact for the user.

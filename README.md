### Mobile Developer ðŸ“±

I'm a systems engineer student, I like to build mobile apps and always be updated about the latest technologies and tendencies about mobile development. 
My main framework is Flutter for hybrid mobile development, and my main programming languages are Dart and Java. 
Also I like to be constantly improving the UI/UX section in my projects so they can generate an impact for the user.
